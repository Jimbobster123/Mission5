    <h2 class="h4">Why I love making Italian food</h2>

    <p>
        I love making Italian food because it’s hands-on and rewarding. A few simple ingredients can turn into
        something that feels special, especially when you take your time and do it the right way. The main ingredients 
        for any Italian dish is pasta, tomatoes, and meat!
    </p>

    <p>
        I enjoy learning the small details that make a big difference—how to salt pasta water, when to add garlic,
        how to build a sauce, and how to balance flavors. It’s a hobby where you can always improve. Some of the 
        best chefs in the world will let there pasta sauce simmer for over night to make sure that their sauce has 
        the best flavor.
    </p>

    <p>
        The best part is sharing it. Cooking for people (or with people) turns a normal night into something memorable.
        And honestly… leftovers are a win too.
